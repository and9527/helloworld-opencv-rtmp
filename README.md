# OpenCV RTMP:// "Hello World"

Experiments in Python with OpenCV and RTMP streams (`rtmp://`).

## Setup

This was developed with Python 3.6 and it's recommended you use at least that too.

Optionally set up a virtualenv then install the requirements with `pip` like so...

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
